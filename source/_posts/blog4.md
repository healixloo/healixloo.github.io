鲍勃.迪伦得了诺贝尔文学奖，理由是：“Bob Dylan用美国传统歌曲创造了新的诗意表达”。这无疑是争议超多的一次颁奖，很多人都说，为什么把诺贝尔文学奖颁给一搞音乐的？撇开对他的各种争论，光就他的歌词而论，确实有大部分诗歌里没有的表达。

No.1 Blowin' in the Wind 《在风中飘荡》

How many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man?
How many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand?
Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly
Before they’re forever banned?
The answer, my friend, is blowin’ in the wind
The answer is blowin’ in the wind
一个男人要走过多少条路
才能被称为一个男人
一只白鸽子要越过多少海水
才能在沙滩上长眠
炮弹在天上要飞多少次
才能被永远禁止
答案，我的朋友，在风中飘荡
答案在风中飘荡

No.2 A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall 《暴雨将至》 

Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?
Oh, where have you been, my darling young one?
I've stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains,
I've walked and I've crawled on six crooked highways,
I've stepped in the middle of seven sad forests,
I've been out in front of a dozen dead oceans,
I've been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard,
And it's a hard, and it's a hard, it's a hard, and it's a hard,
And it's a hard rain's a-gonna fall.
啊，你曾去过何处，我那蓝眼睛的孩子
啊，你曾去过何处，我年轻的情人
我步履蹒跚，翻过十二座薄雾笼罩的山峦
我匍匐爬过六条蜿蜒的道路
我曾走入七座悲伤森林的心脏
我也曾直面十二片死亡之海
我曾在荒冢中跋涉过上万里的路程
暴雨，暴雨，
暴雨即将到来

No.3 Like a rolling stone 《像一块滚石》 

Once upon a time you dressed so fine
You threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you ?
People'd call, say,"Beware doll, you're bound to fall"
You thought they were all kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging for your next meal
How does it feel
很久以前，你衣着光鲜
在得意之时给流浪汉们施舍硬币，不是吗？
人们跟你喊道，“当心点，宝贝儿，你这样定会碰钉子的。”
而你曾以为他们都不过在取笑你
你曾嘲笑
每个人都无所事事，只会结伴闲逛
而现在你并不那么高谈阔论了
现在你也没那么不可一世
当你不得不为下一顿饭而奔波劳碌
这感觉如何？

No.4 Mr Tambourine Man 《铃鼓先生》 

Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free,
Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands,
With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves,
Let me forget about today until tomorrow.
是的，在钻石的天空下起舞，一只手自在地挥呀挥
侧影反衬着海水，四周是圆场的黄沙
带着一切记忆与命运，一齐潜入翻涌的波涛之下
且让我忘记今日直到明天来临

No.5 Don't Think Twice, It's All Right 《别想太多，没事的》 

It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe 
Even you don't know by now 
And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
It'll never do somehow.
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out your window and I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm traveling on
Don't think twice, it's all right
亲爱的，坐下来再多想是没有用的 
即使你到现在都还不清楚 
亲爱的，坐下来再多想是没有用的 
这从来都不会有任何用 
当天色破晓，公鸡开始啼叫 
你看向窗外，而我已经远走 
亲爱的你就是我旅行的理由 
不过别多想了，这没什么。 

No.6 It's Alright Ma (I'm Only Bleeding) 《没事妈妈，我只是在流血》 

Pointed threats they bluff with scorn 
Suicide remarks are torn 
From the fool’s gold mouthpiece the hollow horn 
Plays wasted words proves to warn 
That he not busy being born is busy dying 
他们虚张声势与轻蔑地威胁
自杀言论被撕碎
傻瓜的黄金喉舌是空号角
说着无用的言论以证明价值
不是忙于生存的人-你们这是自寻死路

No.7 Just Like a Woman 《就像一个女人》

She takes just like a woman, yes, she does
She makes love just like a woman, yes, she does
And she aches just like a woman
But she breaks just like a little girl
是的她索取得像个女人
是的她做爱的时候像个女人
她渴望的时候像个女人
可她说分手的时候就像个小姑娘

No.8 Knockin' on Heaven's Door 《敲开天堂的门》 

Mama, take this badge off of me 
I can't use it anymore 
It's getting dark too dark to see 
Feels like I'm knocking on heaven's door
Knock, knock, knockin' on heaven's door 
妈妈，给我脱下这个警章吧
我没法子佩戴它了
天越来越暗，暗得看不清
我感觉我想在叩天国的门
敲啊敲
叩敲天国的门

No.9 The Times They Are a-Changin'《变革的时代》

Come senators, congressmen
Please heed the call
Don't stand in the doorway
Don't block up the hall
For he that gets hurt
Will be he who has stalled
There's a battle outside
And it is ragin'
It'll soon shake your windows
And rattle your walls
For the times they are a-changin'.
议员们
请留心这呼声
别把着门
别让门廊堵得很
郁闷的准是抛了锚的人
外面的斗争
正咆哮阵阵
就快把你们的窗子震
你们的墙快咯咯作声
因时代变革已成真

No.10 Masters of War《战争贩子》

Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
让我来问问你们吧，
金钱真是万能的吗？
你们以为它果真能够，
买到你们所需的饶恕？
我想你们终会发现，
在死神宣告降临之时，
你们挣得的所有金钱，
都无法买回你们所谓的灵魂。

鲍勃.迪伦个人最大的成就，莫过于是以诗般的笔法所挥洒而出的时而讽喻愤慨、时而表达个人喜悦却都发人省思的词句，为通俗音乐创造了全新的语言。
